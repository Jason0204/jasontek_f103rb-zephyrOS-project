Standard C Library
##################

The kernel currently provides only the minimal subset of the
standard C library required to meet the kernel's own needs,
primarily in the areas of string manipulation and display.

Applications that require a more extensive C library can either submit
contributions that enhance the existing library or substitute
a replacement library.
