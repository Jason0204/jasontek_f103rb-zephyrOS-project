	  Sets log level for Ethernet Device Drivers.
	  Levels are:
	  0 OFF, do not write
	  1 ERROR, only write SYS_LOG_ERR
	  2 WARNING, write SYS_LOG_WRN in adition to previous level
	  3 INFO, write SYS_LOG_INF in adition to previous levels
	  4 DEBUG, write SYS_LOG_DBG in adition to previous levels

config ETH_INIT_PRIORITY
	int

	help
	  Ethernet device driver initialization priority.
	  Do not mess with it unless you know what you are doing.
	  Note that the priority needs to be lower than the net stack
	  so that it can start before the networking sub-system.

	  When interrupts fire, the shared IRQ driver is notified. Then the shared IRQ

	  Specify the device name for the shared IRQ driver. It is used to register
	  this driver with the shared IRQ driver, so interrupts can be dispatched
	  correctly.
