config	SLIP_DRV_NAME
	string "SLIP Driver name"
	default "slip"
	help
	  This option sets the driver name

config	SLIP_MTU
	int "SLIP MTU"
	default 1500
	range 80 1500
	help
	  This option sets the MTU for the SLIP connection.
	  The value is only used when fragmenting the network
	  data into net_buf's. The actual SLIP connection
	  does not use this value.

config	SLIP_DEBUG
	bool "SLIP driver debug"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables debug support for SLIP driver.

config	SLIP_STATISTICS
	bool "SLIP network connection statistics"
	default n
	help
	  This option enables statistics support for SLIP driver.

config  SLIP_TAP
	bool "Use TAP interface to host"
	default n
	select NET_L2_ETHERNET
	help
	  By default TUN is used. In TAP the Ethernet frames
	  are transferred over SLIP.
