comment "Bluetooth HCI Driver Options"

# Controller support is an HCI driver in itself, so these HCI driver
# options are only applicable if controller support hasn't been enabled.

config BLUETOOTH_HOST_BUFFERS
	bool "Host managed incoming data buffers"
	help
	  Enable this to have the host stack manage incoming ACL data
	  and HCI event buffers. This makes sense for all HCI drivers
	  that talk to a controller running on a different CPU.

	  If the controller resides in the same address space it may
	  make sense to have the lower layers manage these buffers, in
	  which case this option can be left disabled.

config BLUETOOTH_DEBUG_HCI_DRIVER

	  This option enables debug support for the chosen
	  Bluetooth HCI driver

	default "UART_0"
	depends on BLUETOOTH_UART
	help
	  This option specifies the name of UART device to be used
	  for Bluetooth.
