/**
 * @file
 * @brief ARM Cortex-M systick device driver
 *
 * This module implements the kernel's CORTEX-M ARM's systick device driver.
 * It provides the standard kernel "system clock driver" interfaces.
 *
 * The driver utilizes systick to provide kernel ticks.
 *
 * \INTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
 * The systick device provides a 24-bit clear-on-write, decrementing,
 * wrap-on-zero counter. Only edge sensitive triggered interrupt is supported.
 *
 * \INTERNAL PACKAGING DETAILS
 * The systick device driver is part of the microkernel in both a monolithic
 * kernel system and a split kernel system; it is not included in the
 * nanokernel portion of a split kernel.
 *
 * The device driver is also part of a nanokernel-only system, but omits more
 * complex capabilities (such as tickless idle support) that are only used in
 * conjunction with a microkernel.
