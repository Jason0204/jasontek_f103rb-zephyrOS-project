/**
 * @file
 * @brief Initialize system clock driver
 *
 * Initializing the timer driver is done in this module to reduce code
 * duplication.  Although both nanokernel and microkernel systems initialize
 * the timer driver at the same point, the two systems differ in when the system
 * can begin to process system clock ticks.  A nanokernel system can process
 * system clock ticks once the driver has initialized.  However, in a
 * microkernel system all system clock ticks are deferred (and stored on the
 * kernel server command stack) until the kernel server fiber starts and begins
 * processing any queued ticks.
