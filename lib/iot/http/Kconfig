config HTTP_PARSER
	bool
	prompt "HTTP Parser support"
	default n
	help
	This option enables the http_parser library from nodejs.
	This parser requires some string-related routines commonly
	provided by a libc implementation. So, MINIMAL_LIBC_EXTENDED
	can be used here to resolve all the required dependencies.

config HTTP_PARSER_STRICT
	bool
	prompt "HTTP strict parsing"
	default n
	depends on HTTP_PARSER
	help
	This option enables the strict parsing option
