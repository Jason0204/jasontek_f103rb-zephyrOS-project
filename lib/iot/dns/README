DNS Client API for Zephyr
=========================


Known limitations:

- Synchronous queries
- Only IPv4 and IPv6 records can be handled
- Minimal protocol validation. If you do not trust your DNS server,
  it is time to change it :)


Usage:

Before calling the resolver, it must be initialized via the 'dns_init'
routine.

'dnsX_resolve_quick' routines just return the first IP address.
However, domain names may be served by more IP addresses, so
'dnsX_resolve' routines may be more useful.

See samples/net/dns_client/src/main.c.
