This is a sample app which displays an incrementing
counter through the Grove LCD, with changing backlight.

Arduino 101
===========
You will need to connect the Grove LCD via the shield
onto the Arduino 101. Additionally, you will need to
use 2 pull-up resistors (10k Ohm) between the SCL/SDA
lines and 3.3V. The I2C lines on Quark SE Sensor
Subsystem does not have internal pull-up, so external
one is required.
