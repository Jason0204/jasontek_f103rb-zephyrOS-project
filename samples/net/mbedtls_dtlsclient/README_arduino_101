DTLS Client for Arduino 101
==========================

The DTLS Client can be tested on top of the Arduino 101 board by
adding an Ethernet daughter board.


Requirements
============

- Arduino 101
- ENC28J60
- LAN for testing purposes


Arduino 101 and ENC28J60 connection
===================================

The ENC28J60 is an Ethernet device with SPI interface. The following
pins must be connected from the ENC28J60 device to the Arduino 101
board:

Arduino 101     ENC28J60
------------------------
D13             SCK
D12             SO
D11             SI
D10             CS
D04             INT
3.3V            VCC
GDN             GND


Build
=====

By default, make will build the sample for the QEMU-x86 board.
For the Arduino 101 board, type:

make pristine && make BOARD=arduino_101

To load the binary in the development board follow the steps
indicated here:
