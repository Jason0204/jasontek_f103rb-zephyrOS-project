Linking with a static library
#############################

This sample shows how to link a static library to a Zephyr application.
A sample library is also included.

Read mylib/Makefile to discover how to use the Zephyr's toolchain
to build a static library.

If the library's source code is available, perhaps it could be more
easier to integrate that source code to your application than creating
the static library.


Build instructions
==================

1. It is assumed that ZEPHYR_GCC_VARIANT and ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR
variables are already set. See:

https://www.zephyrproject.org/doc/getting_started/getting_started.html

2. source $ZEPHYR/zephyr-env.sh

   Where $ZEPHYR points to the directory that contains the zephyr
   repository.

3. make

4. make run
