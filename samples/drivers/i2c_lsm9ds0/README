I2C LSM9DS0 Sample Application
==============================

This sample application illustrates how to use I2C APIs from Zephyr.
It requires an external device in order to work. The external device
is the accelerometer from LSM9DS0. The datasheet can be found in:
https://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/LSM9DS0.pdf

The application is very simple. It simply reads the 'WHO AM I' register
from the accelerometer and check if matches with the value described in
the datasheet.

Below follows the wiring information for each board this samples has been
tested.
