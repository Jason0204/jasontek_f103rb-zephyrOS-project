Starting a timer
 Case 1: Add to an empty timer list
 Case 2: Add to the end of the timer list (big tick value)
 Case 3: Add to the start of the timer list (small tick value)
 Case 4: Add to the middle of the timer list (medium tick value)

Stopping a timer
 No point to stop a non-existent timer
 Case 1: Stop one at the head of the list (nothing waiting on it)
 Case 2: Stop one at the end of the list (nothing waiting on it)
 Case 3: Stop one in the middle of the list (nothing waiting on it)
 Case 4: Stop the last in the list (nothing waiting on it)
 Case 5: Stop a timer that had a fiber waiting on it

Timer Expiry
 Case 1: Timer has expired
 Case 2: Timer has not expired
 Case 3: Wait for a timer to expire

Expired timers can use the sys_tick_get_32() and sys_tick_delta() routines
to check the results against the timer routines.

This test set does not yet test/verify sys_cycle_get_32()--that must still be
done.
