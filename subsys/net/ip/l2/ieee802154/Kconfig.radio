	bool "IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA-CA radio protocol"
	help
	  Use CSMA-CA mechanism to transmit packets. This is the most common
	  way of transmitting packets and fits most of all the usage.
	  At least until the version 2011 of the specification.

config NET_L2_IEEE802154_RADIO_ALOHA
	bool "IEEE 802.15.4 Aloha radio protocol"
	help
	  Use Aloha mechanism to transmit packets. This is a simplistic
	  way of transmitting packets and fits contexts where radio spectrum
	  is not too heavily loaded.
