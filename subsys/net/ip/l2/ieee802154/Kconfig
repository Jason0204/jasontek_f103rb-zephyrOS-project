	help
	  This is a TEST ONLY support. Do not use that in production!
	  This is not spec compliant. This is added for 2 reasons:
	  to support legacy stack behavior and for testing. PAN ID is fixed
	  as well as the channel. The device is not able to scan, associate
	  to a PAN or anything else like that. You have been warned.

	help
	  This is the level for PAN device, not PAN coordinator. This will make
	  possible to do active and/or passive scans, as well as associating
	  and disassociating to/from a PAN. Current support is very fragile,
	  thus it is not set as the default level
