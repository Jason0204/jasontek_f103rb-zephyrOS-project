The CC3200 SDK provides a peripheral driver library and hardware
register access header files for the Texas Instruments SimpleLink
CC3200 SoC.

The current version supported in Zephyr is CC3200 SDK V1.2.0, downloaded
from:

	http://www.ti.com/tool/cc3200sdk

Files in driverlib/ and inc/ are copied from an SDK installation
(without modification).

Setting CONFIG_CC3200SDK_BUILTIN allows building those files within
the Zephyr ext/hal/ subdirectory.

Setting CONFIG_CC3200SDK_INSTALL_PATH and CONFIG_CC3200SDK_LIBRARY enables
linking with the library provided by the CC3200 SDK, installed separately.
